description = "A replication system, that focuses on optimizations. Thanks to Bridgenet, sadly it can't utilize any better networking library due to the lack of data type specification. This is version 2.0 which aims to remove the need for a :Set function and defers to straight changing of values i.e for example Replica.Data.Currency = 1000 would cus the data to change and replicate said change to the client."
